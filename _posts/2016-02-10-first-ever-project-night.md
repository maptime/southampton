This is the twelfth Maptime Southampton meetup!
It has been discussed at previous meetups that we often don't get the spare time to work on things that we'd like to - the fun things or the side projects. That's why we're having our first ever project night! 
This is 3 hours dedicated to working on that map, editing OSM, learning that new thing, working together on a project - basically 3 hours to do what you want. And equally importantly, to hang out with other Maptimers, learn, share things and have fun!
There will also be time at the start for a few short presentations (e.g. I will show you my latest adventures in using Github pages and learning the basics of html to build a simple online portfolio) so if you have something you'd like to share then please let me know.
As always this will be a friendly, informal event so please come along to learn, share, work and map! :)
Beginners are encouraged, and be sure to bring your laptop
