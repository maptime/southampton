Last week saw FOSS4GUK (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) come to Southampton...and it was awesome!

I was pleased to see that Maptime Southampton was well represented at the event and I gave a [talk](goo.gl/ms8Uxx) about what we do. I hope to have encouraged a few more peeps to attend a local Maptime, or better still, start their own chapter.

The open source geo community is fantastic - full of fun, friendly peeps who are all keen to learn and share their knowledge which made for a really good event. I got to meet lots of peeps from Twitter which is always nice and saw some really interesting talks which I will summarise at a future meetup.

As well as all the amazing software on show my biggest take away was that this is a fantastic community to be involved in and one that I'm proud to be part of. I did note a lack of cartography in the talks and workshops so I will be submitting something for the next event to put a focus on the importance of good map design.
