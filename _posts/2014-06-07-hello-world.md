So, it may be well be 14 months late, but like they say, "better late than never." Finally Maptime Southampton has a website.

This is where all our meetups will be promoted, as well as on Twitter of course! This is also where you will fid writeups of our events and any other relevant news etc.

Bookmark, favourite or even jot the url down for this page to ensure that you don't miss a meetup.

Happy Mapping :)
