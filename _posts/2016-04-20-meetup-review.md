On Wednesday 13th April we met once again in The Art House cafe in Southampton for the 13th time. This time we were talking and learning all about Lidar.

Lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) is a surveying technology from which lots of amazing data is produced. In the UK, lots of Lidar-derived data has been released recently and so it has become quite a hot topic and this was a great opportunity to learn more and hear how people are using it.

We had 4 presenters and were also treated to a fantastic demo from [Tom](https://twitter.com/TomTKeogh) of [Snowflake Software](http://www.snowflakesoftware.com/), our sponsor for the evening. 

[Rose-Ellen](https://twitter.com/rocketnelly) got the ball rolling by showing us how to use Lidar data in QGIS - there are lots of tools availabale for analysis and visualisation.

[Jamie](https://twitter.com/dt99jay) gave us a great demo of his new custom 3D printing app which uses open Lidar data. This was very impressive and a superb example of what can be achieved - you can even make jewellery!

We had a nice insight into how the [Channel Coastal Observatory](http://www.channelcoast.org/) capture and use data for coastal monitoring from [Sarah](https://twitter.com/sarahgeijsels). [Liz](https://twitter.com/birdmaps?lang=en-gb) then gave us some great tips on where to get Lidar-derived data from - with special mention to the Environment Agency for all their lovely free and open data.

See you all soon :)

Happy mapping
