On Wednesday (10th Feb) we met in The Art House cafe in Southampton for the 12th time. This was the first time we have tried out the 'project night' format and I must admit that I didn't really know what to expect. Turns out it was awesome!

There were 14 of us including quite a few new faces which is always nice to see. We had a real mix of interests in the room but after a quick round-the-table it was clear that there were many overlapping/complimentary interests. I presented a few bits and pieces that I have worked on recently and so did regular Maptimer and local geoninja, Nick Duggan (@dragons8mycat on Twitter).

After that the evening organically turned into a bunch of really interesting conversations, from open point cloud data, to editing OSM, to cycle route data and lots more. Lots of good knowledge was shared and there were lots of ideas generated and good links made between people and projects.

This is a format that we will defnitely use again. Next month I'm thinking about focussing on Lidar data; good sources, capture techniques, good software for manipulating/visualising/analysing and anything else releated to Lidar. 
If you would be interested in presenting then please le me know. Email charleyglynn@virginmedia.com
