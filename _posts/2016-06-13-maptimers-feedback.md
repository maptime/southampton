On Tuesday 14th June, the totally awesome [FOSS4GUK](http://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2016/) event comes to Southampton and I will be giving a talk about Maptime!

I want to spread the word about all the great stuff we've done here in Southampton and hopefully encourage other peeps to attend or even start up their own local chapters. I thought a good way to do this would be to use some quotes from our own Maptimer's experiences. Thanks to all who have replied - I wanted to share those quotes here as they made me very proud and they really show what Maptime is all about:

"I'm not a professional GIS person but use Ordnance Survey and Environment Agency open data in a couple of spare-time projects. Maptime has been a great way to informally learn more about GIS tools and data, chat over ideas and meet friendly and knowledgeable people who use geographic tools in their working lives."

"I have really enjoyed Maptime meetings. I don’t know much about digital mapping but have picked up some good tips, but more importantly feel part of a much bigger and knowledgeable community of map enthusiasts. Everyone is friendly and Charley is really excellent at leading the maptime sessions and making them inclusive to all."

"Maptime is a really fun way of meeting fellow GI people in the southampton area and beyond plus learning about the latest open source gis stuff out there. I've really enjoyed meeting new people and learning new stuff in a chilled and fun setting."

"I love maptime, it has introduced me to technologies/applications I hadn’t used (very often) before like mapbox and QGis - which might be daunting to start using on your own. It’s also a great way of informally meeting other geospatial professionals/geogeeks to exchange data, tips and ideas with. But not only geo-professionals come along, people who make use of spatial data in a very broad sense (artists, community groups, foragers…) come along as well, which leads to refreshing insights and collaborations."

"I love the approach and the attitude - the learning never stops" 

"Maptime brings together the perspectives of a diverse map audience; I find it very valuable that not all attendees are from the direct cartographic and geographic industries." 

"I find the sessions useful since they highlight web software applications and open data sources that can be used to make mapping an interactive and learning experience"
